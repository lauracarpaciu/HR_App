#What is an HR database?
You can view it as the central hub for all of your employee data. Human resources professionals use the software to store the information about staff.

In a database youâ€™ll typically store information along the lines of:

Employee details (such as name, address, contact details, emergency contact name and number).
Information about your managers.
Information about your job_history and job_grades.

Employee management systems are useful for running a smooth organization, especially organizations of scale. It assists HR personnel to keep track of employee information such as salary details, attendance/leave records, overall performance and more.
